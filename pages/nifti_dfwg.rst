The Data Format Working Group (DFWG) is charged with arriving at a
technical solution to the problem of multiple data formats used in
fMRI research. This was identified by many investigators as a
fundamental obstacle to fMRI fulfilling the promise it has to
elucidate brain function. The solution arrived at by the DFWG will not
be imposed on the research community, but several groups that develop
fMRI-related software have already indicated their willingness to
adopt the solution. Suggestions for membership on the DFWG were
broadly solicited from the research community.

The following are the original members of the NIfTI DFWG in 2004, in
alphabetical order:
